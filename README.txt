1. Introduction

-This is a simple document on how to run denoising (codes can also be used for deblurring) experiments on images corrupted with Poisson noise.

2. Instructions

-Make sure all the related ".m" files are in one folder. The main solver for P-HONOGSTV algoritm is "Prop_Poiss.m". Inside the main solver, the overlapping group sparse (OGS) solver "gstvdm.m" is called.

To start a simple denoising demo, run the matlab script "Prop_DemoPoiss.m".
